Title:
Exploring Complex Graph Representations of Highway Networks for Traffic Speed Forecasting

Abstract:
Traffic speed forecasting, a critical endeavor in urban planning and transporta-
tion, requires the construction of sophisticated models capable of navigating
the multifaceted dynamics of traffic systems. Current techniques, including
machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, and various deep learn-
ing approaches (CNN, RNN), have historically grappled with two primary
challenges: the accurate identification of influential features amidst countless
variables, and the potential of long-term forecasts. Our research introduces
an advanced solution to these issues through the implementation of Spatial-
Temporal Graph Attention Networks (ST-GAT), which are designed to address
the complex spatial-temporal dependencies that traditional methods often fail
to capture. Our innovative approach involves the construction of six different
graphs, each trained using two distinct ST-GAT models-ST-GAT Single Edge
and ST-GAT Edge Type-differentiated by their handling of edge types. This
categorization allows for a detailed scrutiny of how different combinations
of node and edge features impact the modelsâ€™ ability to forecast traffic speed
with high accuracy, especially over longer time intervals. Through this inves-
tigation, we can observe the significance of edge weights and node feature
selection in improving predictive performance, thus offering new insights into
the plethora of factors influencing traffic dynamics. Preliminary results from
our exploration indicate an improvement in the accuracy of traffic flow pre-
dictions, particularly for future forecasts. This success not only validates the
potential of our ST-GAT framework to revolutionize traffic prediction strate-
gies but also highlights the importance of leveraging graph-based modeling to
overcome the limitations faced by existing methodologies. By capturing the
nuanced interactions within traffic systems, our work sets the stage for more
adaptive urban transportation networks, reflecting a significant step forward
in the quest to enhance infrastructure management and planning.
